    """
    MovieLens: Loads and handles handles the MovieLens-100k dataset

        The setting is that of regression on a specific node of the graph. That
        is, given a graph, and an incomplete graph signal on that graph, we want
        to estimate the value of the signal on a specific node.
        
        If, for instance, we have a movie-based graph, then the graph signal
        corresponds to the ratings that a given user gave to some of the movies.
        The objective is to estimate how that particular user would rate one
        of the other available movies. (Same holds by interchanging 'movie' with
        'user' in this paragraph)

    Initialization:

    Input:
        graphType('user' or 'movie'): which underlying graph to build; 'user'
            for user-based graph (each node is a user), and 'movie' for 
            movie-based (each node is a movie); this also determines the data,
            on a user-based graph, each data sample (each graph signal) 
            corresponds to a movie, and on the movie-based graph, each data
            sample corresponds to a user.
        labelID (list of int or 'all'): these are the specific nodes on which
            we will be looking to interpolate; this has effect in the building
            of the training, validation and test sets, since only data samples
            that have a value at that node can be used
        ratioTrain (float): ratio of the total samples to be part of the
            validation set
        ratioValid (float): ratio of the train samples to be part of the
            validation set
        dataDir (string): directory where to download the movie-lens dataset to/
            to check if it has already been downloaded
        keepIsolatedNodes (bool): If False, get rid of isolated nodes
        forceUndirected (bool): If True, create an undirected graph
        forceConnected (bool): If True, ensure that the resulting graph is
            connected
        kNN (int): sparsify this graph keeping kNN nearest neighbors
        minRatings (int, default: 0): get rid of all columns and rows with
            less than minRatings ratings (for minRatings = 0, just keep all
            the matrix)
        interpolate (bool, default: False): if True, interpolates the matrix by
            means of a nearest-neighbor rule before creating the graph signals
            (i.e. all the graph signals will have complete ratings)
            >> Obs.: Just using these signals to interpolate the remaining 
                rating can be interpreted as a typical baseline.
        dataType (dtype): type of loaded data (default: np.float64)
        device (device): where to store the data (e.g., 'cpu', 'cuda:0', etc.)
        
    The resulting dataset consists of triads (signal, target, labelID) where:
        - the signal contains the ratings given by some data sample to all nodes
          with a 0 for the rating corresponding to the labelID node (note that,
          if interpolate = False, then there will also be zeros in other nodes
          that have not been rated)
        - target is the value of the rating at the corresponding labelID node
        - labelID is the label of the node whose rating has been removed
        In other words, we want to use signal to estimate the value target at
        the node labelID.
    
    Methods:
        
    .loadData(filename, [dataDir]): loads the data from dataDir (if not
        provided, the internally stored one is used) and saves it as filename;
        if the data has already been processed and saved as 'filename', then
        it will be just loaded.
        
    .createGraph(): creates a graphType-based graph with the previously
        established options (undirected, isolated, connected, etc.); this graph 
        is always sparsified by means of a nearest-neighbor rule. The graph
        is created containing only data samples in the training set.
        
    .interpolateRatings(): uses a nearest-neighbor rule to interpolate the
        ratings in the graph signal; this means that all zero values that do not
        correspond to labelID are replaced by the average of ratings of the 
        closest neighbors with nonzero ratings.
    
    .getGraph(): fetches the adjacency matrix of the stored graph.
    
    .getIncompleteMatrix(): fetches the incomplete matrix as it was loaded
        from the data.
        
    .getMovieTitles(): fetches a dictionary, where each key is the movieID
        (starting from zero, so that it matches the index of the columns of
        the incomplete matrix; subtract 1 from the movieID of movieLens to 
        get this movieID) and each value is the title of the movie (in string
        format).
        
    .getLabelID(): the index of the node whose data will be regressed; this 
        might differ from the input labelID in that: its count starts from zero,
        its count might have been modified after getting rid of nodes in order
        to build a graph with the desired characteristics
        
    .evaluate(yHat, y): computes the RMSE between the estimated ratings yHat 
        and the actual ratings given in y.
        
    lossValue = .evaluate(yHat, y)
        Input:
            yHat (dtype.array): estimated target
            y (dtype.array): target representation

        Output:
            lossValue (float): regression loss chosen

    .astype(type): change the type of the data matrix arrays.
        Input:
            type (dtype): target type of the variables (e.g. torch.float64,
                numpy.float64, etc.)

    .to(device): if dtype is torch.tensor, move them to the specified device.
        Input:
            device (string): target device to move the variables to (e.g. 'cpu',
                'cuda:0', etc.)
